ESTP-A
We will work together as a team and complete all assignments in an efficient, timely manner.
I hope to be able to lead a team in developing a piece of software, valuing everyone's input and ideas.
Teammates may be unresponsive when trying to be reached, internal conflict with which path to take in the project, scheduling time outside of class that will work for everyone.
I believe each member of my team should strive to do as best as they can, whether it's an A or a B.
I believe we should be able to get an A on every assignment.
Meeting two to three times a week outside of call should be enough depending on the assignment. Meeting face to face over dinner will allow us to communicate to each other what we have accomplished since the last meeting and work on implementing our next additions.
Depending on the skill set of each member, portions of the project will be assigned to whoever can best handle it and get it done in a timely manner.
They will be disciplined and the remaining members will pick up the slack. ("Das Boot")
I believe each member of my team should strive to do as best as they can, however, the quality of work should be acceptable between all members.
The team I am in has worked together on other projects outside of this class, we have good experience working together and all have the same homework schedule.
No.
Two to three times a week.
No, majority.
We will take the most logical and time efficient choice if it comes to that.
We all will facilitate, likely rotating every project.
Ask him/her to spread work out to the other teammates. 
Ask for responsibilities to be spread between the team.
